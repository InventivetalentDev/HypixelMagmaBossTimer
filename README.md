# HypixelMagmaBossTimer
Tracker/Timer Website for the Hypixel Skyblock Magma Boss


## API
You can get the spawn info used by the website and various mods by querying https://hypixel-api.inventivetalent.org/api/skyblock/bosstimer/magma/estimatedSpawn, which will return an `estimate` field which is the UNIX timestamp of the next estimate spawn.  
For more info on the other info returned by the API or more advanced usage, please join [my discord server](https://yeleha.co/discord)
